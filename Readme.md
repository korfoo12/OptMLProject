### Description

This github repository contains the results for the mini-project of "Optimization for Machine learning" (CS-439) course at EPFL. The goal was to gather insights on the performance of different first-order optimizers within Federated Learning setting. In our study, we used CIFAR-10 dataset and split it between 8 clients. Moreover, we studied both algorithm performances for iid and non-iid data split.


### Required libraries

The project was done using Python 3.8.9 with the following libraries:
* torch
* torchvision
* more-itertools
* random
* matplotlib
* numpy
* sklearn
